1. Create a private GitHub repository (monorepo or separate folders for backend &
frontend is fine).
2. Grant access to user: Mitrajit
3. Add a README that includes:
○ How to run backend (Express, Redis, DB, BullMQ worker)
○ How to run frontend
○ How to set up Ethereal Email and env variables
○ Architecture overview:
■ How scheduling works
■ How persistence on restart is handled
■ How rate limiting & concurrency are implemented
○ List of features implemented, mapped to:
■ Backend: scheduler, persistence, rate limiting, concurrency
■ Frontend: login, dashboard, compose, tables, etc.
-----------------Above are completed tasks---------------------------

Add a short demo video (max 5 minutes):
○ Show creating scheduled emails (from frontend or Postman)
-> done
○ Show the dashboard with Scheduled and Sent emails
->done
○ Show a restart scenario:
    => Persistance lets shutdown our worker and restart during time 11:04
    Concept : 
        bullmq adds jobs from the redis into the queue
        Our redis is running and supporst persistance along with rate limiting features,

        when our db goes down as in the scenario our redis still has the job in the queue and loaded in 
        the worker once db comes up and boom task is performed no data is lost no concurrency is lost 

        its 11:04 lets fire up our servers


■ Stop server → start again → future emails still send
○ (Bonus) Briefly demonstrate how rate limiting / delay behaves under load
